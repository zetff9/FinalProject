# Music
Music has always been a part of my life. I knew I was going to be in band from a young age. I started playing the trumpet 
in 5th grade and have been playing it ever since. In high school, I committed much more time to music and it has been a 
huge part of my life for these past 4 and a half years.

## Marching Mizzou
I have been lucky enough to be a member of Marching Mizzou this season and it has been the highlight of my college experience
so far. It was easily one of the best decisions I have ever made and I have met some of the most amazing people through
Marching Mizzou. It really is like one giant family. We all work really hard, but leave plenty of time for fun. 
I have also been given the unique opportunity to travel to Ireland this Spring with Marching Mizzou. This group of people
is one that I am very thankful for and will always stand out as a great one when I look back on this time.
