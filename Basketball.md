# Basketball
A relatively refcent addition to my regular sports viewing is the NBA. I have been watching basketball regularly for 
about seven years now. My favorite team is the *Houston Rockets* since we don't have a team in Kansas City.

## Houston Rockets
The Rockets of recent have been a pretty good team that could never get it done when it counted the most. Most recently losing
in the playoffs to the *Golden State Warriors* for the second straight season. I like the Rockets because of the way they 
rely on the 3-point shot. I find it very exciting when a deep 3-pointer falls, and with a team like the Rockets, that attack
is a nightly occurrence. Led by one of the most efficient scorers in NBA history and my favorite player, James Harden, the 
Rockets with the new addition of Russell Westbrook
[and their supporting cast](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/roster/_/name/hou/houston-rockets) are looking to contend for an
NBA Championship again this year.
