# Football
Another interest of mine is football. I have been a huge fan of the *Kansas City Chiefs* for my whole life. 
I played some football growing up. For the most part, I played Wide Receiver, Cornerback and Safety. I decided to stop playing
organized football after a few head injuries. Although I still love playing a casual pickup game with friends occasionally.


# Kansas City Chiefs
The Chiefs make or break my week. When I find myself looking forward to the next week, the overall tone is usually set by
how well the Chiefs played on Sunday. If they win, it's going to be a great week. But if they lose, that game will remain in
the back of my head until the next one. As a fan of the Chiefs, I have experienced disappointment and heartbreak many times. 
I have been to multiple playoff games that resulted in a loss, and of course last years AFC Championship game 
against the Patriots. But I still stick by the Chiefs with high expectations every year, and look forward to every game. 
The Loyalty of the fans are what makes Arrowhead Stadium, the loudest stadium in the world, one of the best places to play or 
watch a game.
