# Baseball
I have loved baseball since before I can even remember. I played competitive baseball growing up. 
I could hit hard, but was fast too. I played any position in the field, but my favorite spot was Third Base.
My love for baseball extends beyond just playing the sport. I am a huge fan of *Major League Baseball* as well. 
My favorite team is the *Kansas City Royals* and my favorite player on that team is Whit Merrifield. 
However, my favorite player in **ALL** of baseball is Christian Yelich of the *Milwaukee Brewers*. He is so fun to watch.
Knowing that at any moment the game can change because of this one outstanding player is so exciting.

## Kansas City Royals
My favorite team is the *Kansas City Royals*. I have been through the good and bad with the Royals throughout my life.
I have endured many losing seasons as well as a heartbreaking Game 7 loss in the 2014 World Series that I actually attended.
Going through all of that made our victory in the 2015 World Series even sweeter.
